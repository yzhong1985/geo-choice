                <h2 class="blog-post-title">The Idea</h2>

                <p>The inspiration for this project came about during a family conversation. My father, a professor of Economics, mentioned that sites for grocery stores and banks are selected randomly in my home country, Saudi Arabia. The sites repeatedly opened and closed, with no notice, leaving the community without resources. After a lengthy discussion about food deserts, food justice, and the need for vital resources in local communities, an idea was born</p>

                <h2 class="blog-post-title">The Mission</h2>

                <p>Use current technology to build spatial planning models that can deliver resources to those in areas of need with minimal financial risks to businesses. I used US data on Starbucks as a test model because there was a wealth of information available for it. Once the model I created for Starbucks is tested and fine-tuned, I want to use the same process to build models to help spatial planners bring hospitals and banks to communities in Saudi Arabia that have little or no access to them now and end the open-close cycle that continually leaves entire communities in need.</p>
